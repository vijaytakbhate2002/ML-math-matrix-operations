st.markdown("""
To perform operations on matrices, you need to input them in a specific format. Here are the steps to guide you through the process:

1. **Matrix Format**: You should represent the matrix by entering space-separated values for each row, with each row on a new line.

   For example, to input the following matrix:
   ```
   [[1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]]
   ```
   You would enter it as:
   ```
   1 2 3
   4 5 6
   ```

2. **Input Fields**: There are two text areas provided on the **Basic Operations** page where you can enter your matrices. Ensure that you follow the format described above.

3. **Example**: Here‚Äôs an example of how to input two matrices:
   - **Matrix A**:
   ```
   1 2 3
   4 5 6
   ```
   - **Matrix B**:
   ```
   9 8 7
   6 5 4
   ```
   
   Input these in their respective fields and click the operation you wish to perform.

4. **Snapshot**: To give you a clearer idea of how to input values, refer to the snapshot below:

After entering the matrices, you can proceed to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, dot product, and more. Make sure the matrices you input are compatible for the operations you wish to perform.
